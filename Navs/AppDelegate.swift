        //and therefore they frequently share common data.
    //When working with Navigation Controllers,
        //we should not send information from one view controller to another,
        //as we did with single view controllers,
        //but instead create a unique source of data.
    //The most frequently used object to store common data is the AppDelegate object.
    //The advantage presented by this object is that
        //it is the delegate of the UIApplication object created to run the application
        //and therefore it is accessible from anywhere in the code.
